## Getting Started

- **Cube project**. If you don't have a Cube project already, you can use our sample project with e-commerce data. 
You can find the sample data model in this Github repository. 
- This example uses OpenAI API, so you'll need an OpenAI API key.
- Make sure you have Python version `>=` 3.8
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Copy `.env.example` as `.env` and fill it in with your credentials
- Run `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
